            <li>
                This command adds files to the staging area for Git
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                It is considered best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. It helps
                to find a particular change or understanding the changes.

            <h3>git status</h3>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with <i>git status</i>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                a <i>--global</i> flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer.
